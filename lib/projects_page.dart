    details:
        '''Deepalaya School, Gusbethi is a formal educational institution recognized by the Haryana Board of School Education (HBSE).Started in1998, the school has completed more than 20 years of service, providing a sense of self-reliance through education in a relatively underdeveloped area of the Mewat district. 
A short drive away from Gurgaon lies Mewat. Situated among the fringe districts of Haryana, it is no surprise that this region lies mostly forgotten by the rest of the world. This harsh land is devoid of industrialization and due to the lack of development in the area; illiteracy is rampant among the thousands of villages and countless men, women and children that call Mewat home. Gusbethi is one such village in Mewat with a very high illiteracy rate.
The school has been carrying on the torch of knowledge through value education and personality development for children, giving them access to a new world of opportunities.

In the academic year 2019-20, the school had 1310 students with 553 girls and 753 boys. As we did last year, we got recognition until class 10 from the Haryana School Education Board. All students enrolled in class Xth have passed with nine distinctions.

Literate and educated people are a prerequisite for developing the society. Access to education acts as a catalyst to change. The school aims to:

Develop every child’s potential power of learning and the powers of critical independent thought.
Provide the child with the skills of communication.
Depart knowledge and understanding of the environment in which a child lives, including recognition of the interdependence of man in his various activities upon his fellow men and the physical world around him.

    details:
        '''Project STEADY began in collaboration with Asian Paints with a special focus on reducing drop-out rates in young schoolgirls due to issues of women’s safety prevalent in and around Delhi NCR. Deepalaya decided to start a self-defense program aimed at girls studying in Kasna to teach them skills to protect themselves in dangerous circumstances. Deepalaya was able to expand the project’s reach exponentially through TOT (Training of Trainee) sessions, wherein girls trained in self-defense techniques further trained other girls at their respective schools. So far, 20,927 girls have been provided self-defense training under Project STEADY.
Yoga training was also incorporated within the project to encourage discipline and respect for fellow students, education, and girls. 
We also branched out with a career counseling program, with psychometric tests and personalized reports, to make students aware of job prospects and career paths available to them after the completion of their education. Counseling sessions for the parents are also organized so they can support the education of their children in better ways. 5121 students have benefitted by the career counseling sessions organized by Deepalaya.
Deepalaya also started a unique project for reducing the school drop-out rates through impactful digital learning in the form of TABLABs, which are installed in two schools: LalaLajpatRai College, Dankaur and Government Primary School, Salempur Gujjar. All tablets are pre-loaded with three categories of content -- multimedia, do-it-yourself STEM Experiments and digital books. Activity-oriented and technology-enabled innovative content ensures that learning is a fun, child-driven experience for children in these schools.
In the academic year 2019-20, the project has been able to engaged with 3107 students in different activities like menstrual hygiene sessions, parent engagement activities.''',

    title: 'READY FOR SCHOOL',
    details:
        '''Early Childhood Care and Education CentreLearning is a process that begins at birth. To improve literacy rates in the country, it is imperative to expose children to a culture of learning when they are young. Deepalaya’s Early Childhood Care and Education Centre was inaugurated in collaboration with Infogain India Private Limited for this very purpose on 16th May 2018. The project was set up with 4 major objectives in mind:

1.    To identify 120 children (60 children falling in the age group of 1.5 years to 6 years and 60 children in the age group of 6 to 14 years) from low economic background (with annual household income less than Rs. 2 Lacs) or are from BPL (Below Poverty Line) families as classified by Government 
2.    To provide low-cost nutrition and equip these children with basic gross motor skills, and prepare these children for school 
3.    To mainstream these children into school
4.    To run remedial classes to ensure that the children enrolled in government schools can cope with their curriculum.

To narrow down our target group, regular visits to the nearby two government primary schools were done to conduct meetings with the school principals and teachers so they could refer certain students who had younger siblings. Along with this, regular community mobilization visits have been done by the teachers for the identification of new students to replace the dropout or mainstreamed students. As on 31st March 2019, 225 students have been identified for the centre. Out of these, 109 students have regularly come to the Centre, with 56% of them being girls and 44% boys. During the first year of the programme’s existence, the average attendance of students was between 58% to 70%.  
To tackle the problem of dropouts and absenteeism an individual student tracking system is used. In this tracking system, if any student is absent for 3 days in a row, the teacher makes a home visit the next day. In case their home is not found, a telephonic follow up is done.
As per the level of the student, regular classes are provided in two shifts. First shift starts from 8:00 am and ends at 11:30 am, and the second shift starts from 12:00 noon and continues till 3:30 pm. Students are divided into 3 groups:
 
Group 1 - 1.5 years to 3 years
Group 2 - 3 years to 4 years
Group 3 - 5 years and above

The major focus of this program is the holistic development of children’s personalities and inclusion of healthy attitudes, foundational skills and value education. The centre focuses on the development of gross motor skills, basic language and math skills. The children are taught in a fun, activity-based format through games, role-play, toys, physical activities, storytelling, and drawing & colouring.
Health, hygiene and nutrition play a large role in providing a safe, homely environment for the developmental needs of young children. Healthy practices like maintaining oral hygiene through brushing, hand washing before and after meals, keeping nails trimmed, being neatly dressed, daily combing of hair, proper waste disposal methods and toilet usage techniques are encouraged. A weekly meal chart with healthy meals like fruits, Poha, eggs, and khichdi is followed regularly to meet the nutrition requirements of growing children.
Every month, a PTM (Parents and Teacher Meeting) is organized for a thorough assessment of the student’s progress, class activities, health and hygiene practices, the student’s personal files, work completed, and a follow up for absenteeism and irregular attendance. Parents who are not able to come to the centre for the meeting are individually contacted for follow up meets at their homes or when they come to drop their kids at school. Regular interaction has resulted in a strong rapport with parents and reduced the dropout rates. During the year 7 group meetings are conducted, which was attended by 426 parents.Deepalaya has been able to make significant inroads into Village Mumura, Sector 66, Noida and reached to 225 children and their families. With the support of the community, we look forward to making a ripple in the relatively unexplored sector of early childhood education for the underprivileged in the country. 
In the academic year 2019-20, the project had 78 new enrolments with 49 girls and 29 boys.''',

        '''Deepalaya has been working closely with the state Government of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and also the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. It has been observed that more and more people are taking admission in private schools, even if the parents are not in a position to afford the kind of fees the schools are charging.

    title: 'Sanitary Napkin Project',
    details: '''I’d grown up thinking that using a
Sanitary Napkin was my right,
Well! In fact it’s a privilege….
As we live in a country where our
Women who has attained
the age of Puberty, can’t afford it.

True that! As per the findings of the latest study, “Sanitary Protection: Every Woman’s Health Right”, undertaken by AC Nielsen revealed that only 12 per cent of India’s 355 million menstruating women use sanitary napkins (SNs). Inadequate menstrual protection makes adolescent girls (age group 12-18 years) miss 5 days of school in a month (50 days a year). Over 88% of women resort to shocking alternatives like unhygienic cloth, ashes and husk sand. This study reveals the dismal state of feminine hygiene care in India and shows rampant unhygienic sanitary practices.

Deepalaya noticed that when it comes to menstrual hygiene in India, the story is horrifying. Women use anything available from rags to cow dung for protecting themselves. They are hardly aware of the precautions that are necessary to adopt during menstrual cycle. We surveyed the slum localities and tried to find the reason for not using the “Sanitary Napkins”. Affordability was on reason why women do not use sanitary napkins and asking a male shopkeeper to give them a sanitary napkin was another.

In view of this, Deepalaya and Amway India joined their hands together to kill two birds with one stone – by promoting women entrepreneurs and helping them in manufacturing cheap and easy-to-use sanitary pads. As the unit was to be established in Delhi, we identified a place in slum area of Dwarka & started our “Sanitary Napkin Project” at JJ Colony, Sector-3, Dwarka.

The whole purpose of this project doesn’t end with making the women of this area aware of using the Sanitary Napkin but also helping them in becoming self-reliant and addressing the age-old issues related with menstruation. Keeping that in mind, we created a Self Help Group of women named as Deepalaya Umang SHG to run this project. We helped them in setting up the machines and understanding the process involved in making sanitary napkins. The sanitary napkins are available in the market in the name of “Sangini”. The material used to make this product is fully tested and is harmless to our skin. In their initial stage, we also helped them to market it at very low cost but now this unit is being completely run and managed by the women of the community.''',

Deepalaya Vocational Training centres generally focus on providing students with hands-on instruction and can lead to certification, a diploma, or a certificate. Youth are trained in marketable skills in our centres and are also helped in finding appropriate jobs. The programme fulfils our vision of allowing self-reliance.

Our vocational training programmes empower young people with skills from deprived backgrounds so they have an advantage when it comes to job creation. With assistance in terms of spoken English and career counselling, they enhance their personality traits. Our vocational training projects include units for cutting and tailoring, units for beauty and culture, computer training and centre for personality development.

We have collaborated with the NIIT Computer Courses Foundation, which basically enables students to become efficient data input technicians, software developers, and Advanced Excel and Tally mastery. The curriculum prepared by the NIIT Foundation is in line with industry standards and meets the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) developed NSQF. The programme is riddled with numerous sessions to help them direct interviews and develop their interpersonal skills. Under the guidance of NIIT foundation members, the students will be able to clear the exams online. They are issued certificates after successful completion and are often assisted with work placement.''',

        '''Childhood is the most joyous and happy time in a human ‘s life. However for some like Jitender and his brother, memories of a disastrous childhood days haunt them even today.

Jitender’s father was a drunkard and they used to live in appalling conditions. He and his brother had to do menial jobs to manage their meals and torture from their father further made things difficult for them. Unable to cope up with the dreadful situation at home, little Jitender and his brother left home.

Alone in the streets of Delhi, Jitender even stole vegetables and others things, did all menial jobs. All this just to manage a time of meal for his little brother. With no home, the boys spent nights at railway stations and bus stations.

It was during one of these days that a Deepalaya volunteer found these boys and invited them to the Children’s Home. The invitation was nothing less than a one last opportunity for Jitender to come back to life. With only one hope of food, shelter and care for his little brother, Jitender along with this little brother reached the Deepalaya Children’s home.

He completed his schooling from the Deepalaya school and another school in Mewat district. Later he completed his computer-training course and today Jitender works at Spar – supermarket in Gurgaon.

With an aim to provide a better living for his younger brother, Jitender from the streets of the city came to Deepalaya Children’s home. Complete transformation for a better future was what happened next in his life.''',

        '''As of now, quality healthcare is the privilege of a well-off minority. Semi urban and rural settings still have problems of accessibility to primary healthcare check-ups and follow ups, awareness of lifestyle disorders, lack of counseling about menstrual healthcare, non-availability of medical infrastructure, among others. 

Deepalaya aims to restore healthcare as a universal right by targeting the grassroots. With this goal in mind, we launched the Community Health programme, a multi-faceted project that focuses on establishing sustainable practices and spreading awareness regarding preventive and primitive health among the rural masses.

It was born out of an attempt to reduce dropout rates among children due to unhygienic environments, lack of proper nutrition or healthcare. From immunization programs for children and provision of nutritious food, Deepalaya expanded operations from 1980 onwards to cover prenatal & postnatal care, supplementary nutrition, curative treatments, deforming, and family planning. We also started health camps for seasonal diseases like malaria and dengue, and for chronic ailments like TB, AIDS, leprosy, and cancer detection. Deepalaya has also run sanitation drives for clean toilets, hygienic homes, and potable water. In addition to this, we hold regular health education and awareness camps in the community regarding illnesses like cataract and diabetes. 

Deepalaya addresses the healthcare needs of poor and underprivileged members of various communities through projects like the Chameli Dewan Memorial Rural Health & Mobile Clinic in Gusbethi, the AP Dewan Memorial Clinic in Kalkaji, the Sanjay Colony Health Clinic, and the Integrated Rural Community Health Centre (IRCHC) at Gusbethi. Established in 2005, the Chameli Dewan Rural Health &Mobile Clinic is a mobile van that travels from village to village, providing health check-ups and basic treatment to almost 80,000 individuals living in the region of Mewat. The health unit at Sanjay Colony holds regular health camps like immunization camps for children and pregnant women in collaboration with MCDs. IRCHC caters to the medical needs of people in and around Gusbethi through community meetings, health camps, counseling, dental treatments, and more.

Deepalaya has also set up a Vision Centre in partnership with AIIMS and holds regular eye check-up camps for members of the community in Sanjay Colony, Dwarka, Janakpuri and Gusbethi, Haryana. The eye camp caters to a vast demographic in both urban and rural locations, through tough weather conditions and minimal infrastructure. A dedicated team of ophthalmologists work tirelessly to correct issues due to refractive error, cataract formation and diabetic retinopathy. In remote rural areas in and around Gusbethi, patients are referred to AIIMS for cataract surgery and transported to and from the facility. Patients can get their sight examined, get spectacles for heavily subsidized rates, get diagnosed for cataract and be provided fast tracked surgical treatment, and even have professional counseling for vision problems and blindness due to lifestyle disorders like diabetes. 

Menstrual healthcare is still a rarely talked-about avenue within general healthcare. Hundreds of women living in semi urban and rural areas are at risk of infection due to using unsafe alternatives to sanitary napkins and other menstrual hygiene products. Deepalaya recognises the importance of lifting the stigma around menstruation to be able to provide proper healthcare to girls and women. Menstrual healthcare to young girls has also been recognised as a key catalyst in reducing dropout rates for secondary and senior secondary education.

Our Impact

As of 2019-20, Deepalaya has been able to reach 65116 people through its healthcare programs. In total, in the Community Health Programme, our Mega Health Camps has touched 4291 people. Over 6000 women were provided essential menstrual and pregnancy healthcare services.''',
